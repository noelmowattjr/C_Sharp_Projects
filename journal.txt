Interfaces 101

	What are interfaces?
	-Interfaces describe common behavior, not individual objects.
	-An interface can be shared among several different classes.
	-Classes can implement multiple interfaces.
	-Interfaces provide no logic themselves

	What are generics?
	-Introduced in C# 2.0
	-Type safety, reuse ability, and efficiency
	-Commonly used with data collections

	-Today I learned how to construct and implement an Interface in C#. Interfaces are 	by default public, they cannot contain variables nor code logic; instead only 		methods and properties. In summation Interfaces serve as the behavior standard on 	how the classes who inherit it should behave.

	Using the ‘is’ and ‘as’ operators
	-We can determine if an object implements a particular interface and call the 		methods appropriately.

	-Today I learned that a class can implement more than one Interface, even multiple 	Interfaces.

	Explicit Interfaces
	-what happens when 2 separate interfaces define the same method?
	 To solve this problem, we will use something called explicit Interface 		  implementation
